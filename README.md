  + "Several MIT courses involving numerical computation, including 18.06, 18.303, 18.330, 18.335/6.337, 18.337/6.338, and 18.338, are beginning to use Julia, a fairly new language for technical computing. This page is intended to supplement the Julia documentation with some simple tutorials on installing and using Julia targeted at MIT students. See also our Julia cheatsheet listing a few basic commands, as well as the Learn Julia in Y minutes tutorial page."
  + "Speed, while avoiding the "two-language" problem of requiring C or Fortran for critical code, is the initial draw of Julia, but there are a few other nice points. Unlike Matlab, it is free/open-source software, which eliminates licensing headaches and allows you to look inside the Julia implementation to see how it works (since Julia is mostly written in Julia, its code is much more readable than a language like Python that is largely implemented in low-level C). For calling existing code, it has easy facilities to call external C or Fortran libraries or to call Python libraries. Multiple dispatch makes it especially easy to overload operations and functions for new types (e.g. to add new vector or numeric types). Julia's built-in metaprogramming facilities make it easy to write code that generates other code, essentially allowing you to extend the language as needed. And so on..."
